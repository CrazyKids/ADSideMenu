# ADSideMenu

照抄的[RESideMenu](https://github.com/romaonthego/RESideMenu), Swift 实现。

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+

## Installation
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SnapKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "CrazyKids/ADSideMenu"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `ADSideMenu.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate ADSideMenu into your project manually.
